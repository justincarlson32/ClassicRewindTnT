 Python scripts that harvest data from Warcraft Logs Api
 
 Code is mostly proprietary to my guild's circumstances...
 
 To run:
 
``` ./python GetLogs.py```

This retrieves all of the raw data as is from the WCL API.

The included parsing scripts would need to be modified to work with any other guild's data. 

This includes support for transfered server report merging.

To harvest data from more than 2 years ago, a WCL patreon subscription is required.
